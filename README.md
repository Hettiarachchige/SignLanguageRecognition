# 🤟 Real-Time Sign Language Detection & Sinhala Conversion

A real-time sign language recognition system designed to enhance communication for the hearing-impaired community. This system utilizes AI-powered gesture detection to convert sign language into Sinhala text, promoting accessibility and inclusivity.

## ✨ Features
- **🖐️ Real-Time Gesture Recognition** – Detects and classifies sign language gestures instantly.
- **🔤 Sinhala Text Conversion** – Converts recognized gestures into Sinhala text.
- **🎨 User-Friendly Interface** – Built with React.js for an interactive experience.
- **⚡ AI-Powered Processing** – Uses TensorFlow and OpenCV for efficient gesture recognition.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Frontend:** React.js
- **Backend:** Flask
- **Computer Vision:** OpenCV
- **Machine Learning:** TensorFlow
